# Rejection

If you are reading this and you are an academic, you know what it is like to be rejected at a journal.  Depressed, shocked, angry, bitter, rueful, embarrassed.  These are all perfectly legitimate feelings.

You'll find an essay here which lays out my personal thoughts on rejection---and some strategies for coping.  I don't have much practical advice, but I hope you find it helpful nonetheless.  

Whatever you do, don't give up, don't think the field isn't for you, and don't quit.  It's much earlier than you think.
