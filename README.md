# Rejection

If you are reading this and you are an academic, you know what it is like to be rejected at a journal.  You'll find an essay here which lays out my personal thoughts on rejection, what helped me and what definitely didn't.  I don't have much practical advice, but I hope you find it helpful nonetheless.  Whatever you do, don't give up, don't think the field isn't for you, and don't quit.
